"Sizing can be a bit off, I’m generally xs in gymshark and most other brands this time your xs is almost too small.

Otherwise I love some of the products the quality and performance is definitely there in some items.",3,FALSE

I am so happy you guys are starting to carry/make larger sizes. I am an avid runner and lifter and I have never been able to enjoy your clothes as they were just too small for my bust and curves.

"The quality of the items was very disappointing and I felt obliged to return it, given that i have spent so much money on it. This was very surprising given the saturation of Gymshark on social media platforms. 
However, the returns process was very swift and customer friendly. I did not have to pay any fee to return the items nor have to have a printer available. I was refunded the money without any problems.",2,FALSE

Really worth the price",5,TRUE
"For 'high support' its not that supportive. Although it fitted ok, i did a few practice star jumps to see what the support was like and I'd give it 5/10 - my chest still jumped when i jumped.

"I have the Vital 2.0 shorts in pink and they fit perfectly, so was excited to get them in green.

"I was really hesitant of buying but I am so glad I did. The material is amazing and super stretchy. The set I bought was 100% squat proof and I would say it is sweat proof as well! After a HIIT workout, I was dripping in sweat, but my outfit looked perfect. The waist band is super compressive and really holds you in. It rolls down a little bit if you have pudge when you sit but that is to be expected for me. I also recommend looking at the size guide as everything fits true to size. I am 160 lbs, 5’8”, waist 29 hips 42, I wear a size 6 in lululemon and most denim companies, and ordered a M. I am a 36C and got a L top but I think I could have gotten away with a M in both.

The fit is sensational and so comfy! I can’t wait to wear these to do some exercise,5,TRUE

"Look good in my opinion, and as great storage space",5,TRUE
"Is totally see through, which is not visible in the pictures and the upper band is too tight.",3,FALSE

It’s a tad bit to small for me but overall a great quality gym bag ! I would definitely say it’s more for someone just starting off or someone who doesn’t carry a lot of stuff. The only reason I give this a 4/5 stars is because the shoe compartment is too small. I’m a size 8W and it’s sized more for a 6W. The inside is a very nice material and has a very sleek look. Gives a “I go to the gym A LOT” look lol. I love it !,4,TRUE
My oackage came and it was great and everything I saw was good. Then I took the tag off and immediately  saw rips on the crotch. I haven’t been able to wear the bottoms because of it makes me uncomfortable knowing there’s rips in it. I’ve had to pay 30 pounds to get it restitched,1,FALSE

Absolutely shockingly bad quality leggings. The seams are bobbling on both inner sides as if they have been worn for months. They were like this straight out of the packaging and I didn’t realise until I was at the gym on day 1 of wearing them. Customer service has been terrible. Will not be recommending to everyone like I usually would do. Not happy at all after buying the whole set worth £70. Quality control seems to have been well and truly missed on this batch.

"I am AMAZED! I thought gym wear was just gym wear, nothing special, but after treating myself to some Gymshark clothing I’ve realised that high quality can make a huge difference to the way I look AND feel during workouts.

Delivery was very quick!

The sizing guides worked well as the clothing fits me perfectly!

The gym leggings are the comfiest I’ve ever worn! They’re silky and fit like a second skin all whilst covering any underwear lines and the way they look on my body makes my confidence shoot way up!! The pockets fit my phone which was a huge problem I’ve had with other brands! I’d buy them again just for the pockets!

The 2 sports bras I bought are perfect fitting too, very breathable. They do exactly what I need a sports bra to do! Simple and stylish.

I really cannot fault them! I will certainly be buying some more! I can’t see a reason to buy my gym wear anywhere else right now!

Very happy and recommend!

For reference as I know some clothing doesn’t work well for all sizes- I bought small sizes in both sports bra’s and the leggings. (Uk 6/8)",5,TRUE

They were so see through and the scrunch on the sides were so unflattering. Currently Sending them back.",2,FALSE
"The 2.2L capacity saves a lot of time on refilling over the course of the day. However, the weak point of the design is definitely the hinge of the lid.

Oh and the material just feels really cheap, I’m not even lying to you Walmart sports bras material feel way better than this one does.

I would like at least some reassurance from my chosen bottle that it won't leak, so to state this from the outset makes me think that this bottle has been poorly designed and under testing, most likely leaked enough for them to justify incuding this message.

It's a bit like buying a new car and finding a note on the steering wheel stating: 'this car was not designed to get you to your destination without breaking down'.

Davon abgesehen ist mir der Deckel nach keiner Woche Benutzung direkt abgebrochen und jetzt vertraue ich dem Konstrukt durch reines Zudrücken auch nicht mehr. Wären diese beiden Punkte verbessert, sprich natürlicher Winkel des Mundstückes und stabilerer Deckel, dann wäre es ein tolles Produkt",1,FALSE
Das Produkt soll Spülmaschinen tauglich sein. 1 mal in die Spülmaschine getan direkt verbeult und der Deckel lässt sich nicht mehr drauf schrauben. Absoluter Fehler,1,FALSE
I'm sorry but the bottle is leaky and the top piece then broke off within a week,2,FALSE
It’s a decent jug but the cap comes off completely rather than staying on the bottle. It does hold a good amount of water though.,2,FALSE

the lid broke 1 day after using it :( overall its a cute water bottle,2,FALSE
These are gorg but they’re not stretchy enough for me to squat in!,2,FALSE

This bottle leaks when you drink out of the spout. And if you decide to take off top and drink out of bottle directly the top is not attached like the last model. Too easy to loose!!,2,FALSE

"it’s listed as high support and I really have to disagree. I’m a 32E and ordered a small. It looked quite cool on but when I started jumping, or even walking around for 5 minutes in the house it kind of slipped down and provided no support at all. The straps aren’t adjustable which bigger chested gals tend to need so that as the stretch gives, we can adjust to tighten.

"Really nice product! I like this unique mint colour and all the cool details. The only thing is that it gets dirty quite quickly but I guess that’s expected when you buy something in this kind of a light colour. 
I recommend it because it I think the price was very low and the design is quite unique.",5,TRUE
"The size is perfect and all iss good, but the bottle cap broke off within the first use... still works tho,  but if u loose the cap its bad.",3,FALSE

It’s nice but a bit difficult to do up from behind.,4,TRUE

"It’s just like any old gym bag. Although I do get compliments on the monotone color of the entire bag i just wish it had a little more structure to it. It’s very saggy but just because every gym bag is doesn’t mean this one has to be. 
The shoe compartment is also way too small and doesn’t fit my running shoes.
Lastly, the bag is darker in person. I thought I was going to get this cute baby blue bag but it’s a little more dull than the pictures.",2,FALSE
Leider ust der Deckel der Flasche direjt bei der ersten Benutzung abgebrochen :((,1,FALSE
Not true to size so had to return. Usually wear a small and couldn’t get these up over my thighs. I’m sure the drawstring waistband is great for running but in this case the lack of ‘give’ meant these leggings weren’t suitable.,2,FALSE
Really cute and comfortable but the bottom does roll up quite a lot when working out or just lounging around.,4,TRUE
"These shorts are almost perfect. However, in my opinion, the bottom of any pair of shorts has no need to purposely squeeze the thighs. I was able to see this in the pictures prior to purchasing, so I was aware and while I will continue to regularly use the shorts for exercise, it is a significant negative, for me, and I am very unlikely to repurchase. Other than that, the higher rise is great and shorts for exercise should only be seamless - just change the regular circumference of the leg opening !",3,FALSE
"Excellent material with a super soft feel,supports comfortable and relaxed movement",5,TRUE

awesome socks that feel very comfortable while working out.,5,TRUE
Passt perfekt und schneidet bei Squats nichts ein.,5,TRUE
The location of the tag is awkward and caused me to itch so I was constantly having to adjust it. But other than that it is good basic bra. I would definitely size up as it is a little tighter than most other athletic brands.,4,TRUE
Horrible material. Binned it since it was cheap and on sale,1,FALSE

"Great bag! It’s just very big. If there was a smaller size I would’ve gone with that, this one is like a suitcase. Also no shoulder strap.",4,TRUE
"The most comfortable and supportive socks I've ever worn! The best part is the padding around the toe - I've never had socks with this feature and it is a comfort game-changer.

Das Scharnier ist aus plastic und ist durch einfaches öffnet kaputt gegangen. Leider nicht mehr zu gebrauchen weil die Deckel immer abfallen ich nicht überall 2 Liter Wasser haben mag :(",1,FALSE
"I wish they did bigger sizes as I got the biggest size and they’re not squat proof on me (they’re ok if I make sure to wear plain underwear), but that is my only complaint and is kinda my fault.

Fit nice and suck you in! If you want it for lounge wear order up a size,5,TRUE

"Excellent bag, perfect size, not too big or small, adorable blue color. Perfect for gym gear.",5,TRUE
"I love this bag! It's the perfect size for my shower bag, makeup bag, change of clothes, and other little knick knacks. I wouldn't recommend this one if you're trying to fit a bunch of powerlifting gear or something though. Might be a little too small to fit all that and something like boxing gloves as well--I would size up to something different for that. In this bag, I can fit my shower flip flops in the little separated side pocket and there are plenty of other little pockets inside and out for organizing keys, phone, wallet, etc. The rest is loose space for clothes and water bottle and such. The strap is thin, but comfortable. The quality seems stellar. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I wish it had an additional ""wet pocket"" to run the length of the bag, so I could put a damp bathing suit in there with my googles and swim cap, and keep them apart from my shower shoes. Otherwise this bag is fabulous and the color is so pretty! Such a lovely, steely baby blue.",4,TRUE

Seul point a redire sont les plaques qui servent à ""découper"" le sac qui ne sont pas adaptées à la taille du sac (trop petite).",4,TRUE
"It’s perfect size. My gym provides all the toiletries and hygiene needs. The bag would be small if I had to pack my toiletries/hygiene. Fits in the locker without slanting it upwards. The side zip pocket compartment was too small for shoes, so I took it to my local tailor and made it bigger to fit my shoes.",5,TRUE
"Bought for daughter, she's a size 10/12 and medium fits well, comfy, look good, happy days!",5,TRUE

They are pretty baggy lads. So risk it and get The L not the XL if your waist is 95cm and inseam is 83 so they are a little bit tighter. Thank me later lads.,4,TRUE

"I love my new gym bag. I can keep gym clothes, my shoes, pre-workout, and other items in it. I love the color, and there are plenty of pockets,  mesh and zipped to store items. Only thing I would change if I could would be the side pocket so that I could store my gym shoes there instead of the main pocket.",5,TRUE

This is an amazing brand all together!!! I love Gymshark,5,TRUE
I was having really bad back pain when I would do my 3 mile runs everyday. Little did I realize it was my bra that was the problem. I switched to the Gymshark brand and found the perfect size!! I love how these fit and the material. They hold my girls in place. My back no longer hurts! Running is a lot easier! These are a must have for me now. Bought in every color.,5,TRUE
"My boyfriend looks ridiculously hot in this shirt.  Men, get this, drive the girls crazy.  Females, buy this for your man and then be proud of your good taste whenever he wears it.",5,TRUE
"Very flattering bra, I have a smaller bust so the impact level is just perfect, I imagine it would offer good hold for bigger busts as well.",5,TRUE
It’s really cute and super soft material. It’s pretty cropped so size up if you want it to be longer.,5,TRUE
I didn’t plan on buying this. It was a last second purchase just because I’ve never had one and I thought it might be cool. It was. It’s one of my favorite ways to warm up for leg day.,5,TRUE
"Love the softness, length, pockets, and not baggy.  I'm 5'8 and still have a little extra length, which is usually not the case with items that are not ordered as a tall.  Ordered 2 after giving 1 to my daughter. Can't wait for the cooler weather to wear often.",5,TRUE
The hole to put your foot though is very small and without any elastic:-( That was a showstopper.,1,FALSE
"Can’t say I’d buy one again , the overall size and quality are good, but the fit is awful, tends to roll forward at the neck and shoulders, end up lifting the top back when training !!",3,FALSE
"too small .. depressing. 
NOT Curvy girl friendly",1,FALSE
"There’s a rip going all the way up the butt. Didn’t notice until the first time I went to put them on. They tried to deny the review, but I feel people should be aware that this could happen.",1,FALSE
See through could never do a squat do not buy these,1,FALSE
Completely see through and not correct sizing at all. Couldn’t get my ankle through,2,FALSE
"These do not fit as hoped. I’ve loved every gym shark product I’ve ordered until these. It’s hard to describe, but the fit is just not what it could be.",1,FALSE
This shirt looked NOTHING like how it looks in the picture. Way darker. Looked like the gray version. Very disappointed.,1,FALSE
"Really sorry to leave a bad review, it’s already torn after wearing it for 3 days , extremely poor quality",1,FALSE
I prefer the critical then these. Granted it’s mesh but it doesn’t feel like it will last as long.,3,FALSE
I would love if you could make shorts that fit thicker thigh girls. I need a bigger gap in the leg so it’s a looser fit,1,FALSE
I gave these leggings 3 stars because i don’t think they are true to size. I normally wear a Large in all Gymshark leggings but these seemed too tight all around. Plus they are capri instead of the 7/8. Not so happy with these.,3,FALSE
tight and nipples are very visable which is very negative in my opinion,2,FALSE
"Size was poor for fit, looks like I am wearing 3/4 length bottoms…these were a large! I’m 6ft 2” so used to wearing a large size to get the length. Very disappointed.",1,FALSE
"It’s mostly made in polyester rather than cotton. Resulting in being more like a leggings a bit slim.
Wasn’t expecting that but it’s really comfy for sport and yoga positions. 
Because it has an elastic band it might turn over if you have a bit of belly like myself",3,FALSE
I got an xl and they were too small when I got them,1,FALSE
"First off, there is ZERO stretch in the ankle. There is this raw seem piece at the ankle that is thicker than the rest of the leggings with no stretch whatsoever. Could hardly get it on over my foot. It was tight at the ankle too. Leggings are long and just all around very awkward in the fit. I returned straight away.",2,FALSE
Good quality but arms were a little short. Good fit elsewhere.,4,TRUE
"Es sitzt sehr eng, was ich tendenziell befürworte. Dadurch das der Stoff allerdings sehr dick ist wird das tragen etwas unangenehm im Sommer.",3,FALSE
Die Leggings hat leider überhaupt nicht gepasst… Das Material war schön und blickdicht. Aber an meinen Oberschenkeln und Po war sie viel zu eng. Deswegen war sie auch eher Mid Rise statt High Rise. (Ich bin laut Größentabelle zw M und L und ich hatte eine L bestellt),2,FALSE
My son loves the shirt looks great on him.  The problem is the color is coming out blotchy and now cannot wear it for everyday as looks bad.,3,FALSE
"love the fabric and the cut; fantastic for chest and shoulder days where you really see a great pump in the mirror after your workout! 

one little minor issue is that the sides seem to start curling after a wash or two, which leads to some nip slip accidents at the gym. I've since started getting one size bigger as a result.",5,TRUE
"Super Hosen. Hatte schon mal eine bestellt. Tragen sich genial. Einziger Kritikpunkt, ab der 6. -10. Wäsche ist die Hose nicht mehr schwarz, sondern grau. Schade!",4,TRUE
I give it 4 stars. They’re nice shorts but for some reason I feel like they’re missing something,4,TRUE
"I like the fit of these leggings, however they are easy to sweat through if you sweat a lot (like me). The three stars are because mine have two tiny holes in them after using them twice.",3,FALSE
"I love the way these looked on me, made the booty pop!.. but ripped during 1st use. They also make my lower belly area look a little large :/",4,TRUE
Very comfy shorts for training. Stretchy and stylish. What more can you ask for?,5,TRUE
Lives up to the description 100%. Best shorts I've ever used for lifting.,5,TRUE
"I have 25” thighs and unfortunately with the Medium that I got, the thighs were too tight, so I moved up to Large.  The larges were way too loose in the waist (I have a 33” waist) and I have to pull the string all the way through. Wouldn’t recommend for guys with big thighs and a medium-ish waist.",3,FALSE
"These are so close to being the ideal pair of Joggers. Great fit and stretch, however, let down by a bizarre under-band(?) of some kind, that is around half the size of the desired waist-size you selected. It's not very comfortable and really sucks you in, giving a bad waistline appearance. No clue why this was added, there would have been no risk of these falling down due to the toggles. It feels like you're wearing a second pair of boxers that you can't take off.",4,TRUE
"It fits really nice (size L, 158lbs, 5'4). Love the quality and texture. The only problem is that the material sheds on the first wear. I recommend washing first before you wear.",4,TRUE
"Not only comfortable, it looks so good that it is a confidence boost",5,TRUE
"Die Kombination zwischen normaler Jogginghose und einer Tight ist genial. 
Man hat eine super Bewegungsfreiheit und eine gute Unterstützung der Unterschenkel.
Diese Hose gehört zu meiner Standardausrüstung beim Joggen.",5,TRUE
"Great quality joggers, nice feel and material. My main issue with this was it seemed to run really small. I dont have the biggest legs in the world but I am far off from having a pair of Twigglets for legs and these came up really tight and I ordered a large. My last Gymshark joggers I had were a medium and I bought those when I was 17 and they've just gotten to small so I figured getting a large was the right idea but I will have to probably get an XL or even a XXL.",3,FALSE
"Like the fit but don’t like the fact that they already start to spoil after 2 runs between legs. 
Good point; it stays in place if you run or bike",3,FALSE
"great product awesome fit, no problem to run or workout at gym like how stretch highly recomended",5,TRUE
Tröjan nopprar sig på insidan och det fastnar en del ludd på tröjan under tyvärr men sjukt snygg och magisk passform,4,TRUE
They fit really good. True to size. beautiful leggings but they are see through. That was my only issue with these leggings. Won’t be able to wear them out .,3,FALSE
I actually love/would love these leggings but the sizing is very weird. I usually wear large but I got it in XL just in case and it wouldn't go through my foot!! Dont know if it was labelled wrong or the size is just too small.,2,FALSE
"Amazing, but it is see through with dark underwear",4,TRUE
Super Hose bis auf die Hosenschnur…. Top Qualität…,4,TRUE
"This is my first purchase from gymshark. The shorts feel good and are perfect for running and leg days. My rating is because the third time wore them, the left side pocket zipper came off.",3,FALSE
"Needs at least ONE pocket. Very flexible, good in the gym and to swim with.",4,TRUE
Fits true to size. A good work out tank top. You definitely have to wear a sports bra under it because it is not supportive on its own.,4,TRUE
it runs small. I ordered a L which is usually slightly loose on me and it was like I ordered a small. they became see through because of this as well. they were super cute and I like that they had clear lining that kept them in place.,3,FALSE
"Toller Fit und extrem angenehmes Material. 
Gleich in 2 Farben geholt",5,TRUE
"Amazingly comfortable, well made & a good fit for size",5,TRUE
"Great shorts, probably the best I've worn for leg training.",5,TRUE
"Sized well, Go one size up from your jeans as it’s a slim fit and be careful how you wash them to avoid bubbling",5,TRUE
Super cute! I love the way they look on. They are a bit see through if you have a big butt.,3,FALSE
"Fits amazingly well, and is my new favorite hoodie",5,TRUE
Really comfortable and presentable to wear outside of the house.,5,TRUE
"These joggers are awesome, honesty took a shot in the dark on if id like the color and ended up loving it. The only thing is that the second time I wore them I discovered a whole in the pocket, so Idk if I got a lemon or its poor QC but it nothing too major and I plan on sewing it right up.",3,FALSE
Love these shorts! They are extremely comfortable and fit great! Definitely will be buying other colors!,5,TRUE

Awkward fit on a bigger guy.  But very very comfy.,4,TRUE
"I like the cut, the length, and the durability of the material. The only issue is that the waist band was curling over for me when doing floor exercises (burpees, straight leg lifts, etc). All in all, great pair of shorts.",4,TRUE
"True to size, fits great, very comfy. Only complaint is the wrists are a little tight, and since there are thumb holes it can be difficult to access your smartwatch (if you use one). Also, if you sweat (like I do) it shows up very easily, which isn't a big deal to me but it's worth mentioning. Other than this, it fit perfectly, not restricting and it's flexible.",4,TRUE
"Ordered this for my son.  He is 6ft 1"" with broad shoulders.  Fits him great.",5,TRUE
Very stretchable and breathable. Very good comfort as well.,5,TRUE

"So soft, so comfy! Maybe it’s because it’s men’s but it fits longer than other hoodies I have owned. I would normally get a large in women’s, I went with a small men’s for a more fitted hoodie, it’s perfect and I love it",5,TRUE
HI I LOVE THE LEGGINGS. NICE AND TIGHT. VERY SMOOTH. ON ME. WILL ORDER MORE OF YOUR LEGGINGS,5,TRUE
The are by far the most comfortable joggers / pants I have ever owned. Super soft durable and stretchy.,5,TRUE
"These Seamless 2.0 Legging in Charcoal - are good, a nice firm (hold you all in place) feel, and easy to move & jump around in.  My only reason for 4 stars is that the cuffs on the ankles.  For me they are not necessary and slightly tight.  Otherwise another great purchase from Gymshark",4,TRUE
Great product - highly recommend. I originally bought large but went for medium and it was a better fit.,5,TRUE
"Excellent fit, quality and they’re extremely comfortable. I’ve run two 5k’s in them so far and they held up well. The zipper pocket in the back is perfect for keys and you don’t feel them swinging around. These are my new favorite running shorts.",5,TRUE

"I was a bit surprised when the ankles were tight and a bit hard to get over my heel. BUT I love these. They might be my favorite legging. My hip and waist are different sizes so I usually end up pulling up my workout leggings. With the adjustable tie at the waist, I don't need to do that. I ordered a size L and found them true to size",5,TRUE
I love this shirt but Hope I can get and find other Large size and more colors of it!,5,TRUE

"These shorts are extremely comfortable, I’ve worn them for a few runs now and they are brilliant. It took me a couple runs to notice they actually had the hidden close to the skin pockets, but once I noticed and started using them for my phone and key they worked great! The shorts are close to the skin so don’t flap about while you’re sprinting for a PB, and the main thing I’ve noticed is how light they are, literally feels like a base layer and nothing more which is great while out running.
I immediately went back online to order another pair in another colour.",5,TRUE
"Squat proof, amazing quallity, would definitely recommend",5,TRUE
"These are amazing, fit is just right, booty looks just right. Its all lovely",5,TRUE

BEST LEGGINGS YET. I love the adapt range but these are durable comfy and smooth as hell! i actually ordered in 2 sizes (L and XL) as everyone prior to launch made me think i may size up from my current large but nope perfect in the large! True to size and just the best workout set!,5,TRUE
"The fabric is great, love the waist band - it gives lower tummy control which is fab. They also stay in place so they really a perfect for the gym. Only thing is it’s slightly sheer when I touch my toes.",5,TRUE

Fit great and so comfortable. Like them so much im going to buy another pair,5,TRUE
"The joggers are just adequate, They do not feel great and the fabric is light in weight and just alright . Not my best purhase",3,FALSE
Major camel toe .. cute color but probably wont ever wear out to the gym,1,FALSE
"Great fit, very comfortable 
But the zipper for the pocket broke and the stitches for the elastic at the ankle broke as well, after wearing them 4-5 times",3,FALSE
"Best material out there. Vital and adapt camo is usually my fave, but this one is definitely the best! Need in all the colours! Get back in stock ASAP. Thx ☺️",5,TRUE
They fit great but unfortunately they’re completely see-through,1,FALSE
DEFINITELY SIZE UP! I’ve always gotten a medium in gymshark shorts and these are so much tighter in the stomach and definitely not very flattering on larger quads.  I have to return for a size up,2,FALSE
"Got shorts and joggers, arrived on time, great fit, VERY comfortable. Thanks Gymshark!",5,TRUE
I returned these because the fit is all wrong. The material is great but they don’t sit right at your hips/waist. Bummer because I really wanted to like these. Size down.,2,FALSE
"Really love these leggings! So comfortable, squat proof and fit great, but material does get balls of fluff if it rubs against other material (between thighs, on hips where shirts touch it, etc).",4,TRUE
Great jacket and super comfy! It is super oversized as stated and they’re not kidding haha. Did shrink a little but still fits perfect!,5,TRUE
"love these, i’m 5’6 and 180lbs and purchased a L but i’m usually a M and they fit like a glove",5,TRUE
Love it so much but I ordered size small and it’s a little bit too big! I know its oversize fit but the small look like a xxl regular fit,4,TRUE

"Love everything about these. Great length, nice stretch to them, lightweight and dry quickly. Bought these and the studio tank as my first GS purchases. I’ll be back for more!",5,TRUE
Amazing! so comfortable and when I lift and workout they do not slide.,1,FALSE
They feel cheap and are baggier than I expected. Not worth $60. Theres better quality joggers out there.,2,FALSE
"Extremely disappointed with the quality of these pants. When I went to remove the pants after a workout, the cuffed leg immediately tore. It seemed to have no integrity whatsoever. I wouldn’t recommend these product to anyone.",1,FALSE
The legs roll up which is irritating.I bought these because I got another pair of gymshark biker esque shorts and they fit perfectly. These were not as nice as I wanted them to be.,3,FALSE
I ended up returning these. The material was a heavy cotton that is not great for actually working out and we unnecessarily bulky. Sizing seemed a bit off as well. Just overall not what I'm looking for in gymwear.,1,FALSE
"I HATE the material of all their seamless leggings! It’s stiff, itchy, and smooshes the booty. Gross. Not my fav",2,FALSE
"Leider ist die Leggings sehr durchsichtig, so dass ich sie zurückgeschickt habe. Ansonsten hat sich die Leggings angenehm angefühlt.",1,FALSE
The brand has cheapened its quality by outsourcing hoping to make higher profits. Will never buy again.,1,FALSE
"Poor Quality very thin fabric , very uncomfortable ,",2,FALSE
"Mycket fin passform! Men, trodde den skulle vara i ljusare grått, som bilden. Luddar av sig oavsett 3 tvättar nu.",1,FALSE
"They're as pictured, if you're tall they don't come very far down your legs and you have to wear them as capris. I think I was hoping for the color to be a little less drab (but that's my own fault for choosing them). But overall they are as pictured and feel soft.",3,FALSE
Legging we’re  completely see through couldn’t wear them at all,1,FALSE
"Slightly overpriced for the thinness of the material, more a 20 pound top",3,FALSE
"I absolutely love these leggings and they fit great. The problem is that the first time I tried them on, I noticed a tiny rip in the crotch seam already, even though I was putting them on very carefully to avoid stretching out the waistband or anything else. It was very disappointing for these expensive leggings to already be ripping at the seams with no fault of my own.",3,FALSE
It is a little to trim in the calves and thighs. Material is comfortable & durable.,3,FALSE
"Ce t-shirt taille correctement, il est confortable et absorbe bien la transpiration durant l'effort. Donc de ce côté là rien a dire. Cependant au bout de la 3eme utilisation il y a un gros trou au niveau de l'aisselle... Comme ci la couture navait tout simplement pas tenue. Je precise avoir respecté les règles de lavages recommandées pour ce produit et je ne l'ai pas abîmer durant mon utilisation.",2,FALSE
The Jogger is unfortunately not long enough for me. I’m 180 cm tall. And although I washed it I had after my training black lint everywhere on my legs.,3,FALSE
I got these because I have an older version of the speed shorts that I love.  The liner in these are too small and there is a seam that literally burns the inside of your thighs while running.  I was so excited for these because I love to run in my other pair- these ones- not so much.  Super disappointed!,2,FALSE
"Extremely long not made for short girls, I have a ton of legging scrunched up at the bottom",3,FALSE
Pants ripped after the first day wearing them. Can’t recommend.,1,FALSE
Put it through the wash and the inside came undone and now the drawstring is loose. Shame because they fit nicely,2,FALSE
"It’s massive for its size I literally brought a size medium and when I got it, it was more like a size extra large made me look massive can’t now wear it as it’s so big on me. Shame really as I loved the colour feel like I’ve wasted my money and no offence it’s not like it’s a cheap price!",1,FALSE
These leggings feel like butter and fit your body amazing! The first time I wore these I did some squats and the material ripped. Not what I’d expect from $70 leggings. :(,2,FALSE
"Normally I don’t review but I wish I loved this shorts. The waist is small making it hard for my butt area to be flattering. The material was amazing just wish the back part was flattering, I think it was so tight that it made my butt look flat. Even if I returned it and got a size up I still didn’t like how it made my body look.",2,FALSE
Very pale yellow and see through. Will be returning.,1,FALSE
Ripped in the underbum countor 2:nd time using it :/ Would not recommend.,1,FALSE
"It was comfy and good size but the seams werent of high quality, which made it feel expensive for that price.",3,FALSE
"Super soft shorts and very comfy! If you sweat a lot like me though, it is clearly visible…",3,FALSE
Disappointed. These tights are not squat proof (they are see through when stretched)  and the material has already started to peel.,2,FALSE
Was so disappointed with the shorts as they had a small hole after wearing them once.,2,FALSE
The quad shorts are great for leg day - stretchy enough to let your muscles flex and short enough to let you see your progress.,5,TRUE
"I love the fit of these pants. The right pocket zipper broke after 3 wears, so that wasn't great. Very comfortable, though and perfect after the gym.",3,FALSE
These are very flattering and a lovely design. I ordered my usual size which is a medium and they were too small and felt like if I even tried to work out in them the seams would pop. I sent them back and ordered a large but as this is not my size they don’t fit well. They fall down a lot so I’m constantly adjusting them which is a shame. Every other medium size leggings I own from gymshark fit perfectly so I’m disappointed as I love the design.,3,FALSE
The pocket seams broke after one wash. There’s now a giant hole in one of the pockets,1,FALSE
I love my new gymshark leggings! They are so comfy and give my butt that pop!,5,TRUE
Bought these for my bf. He loves them. Run true to size,5,TRUE
"Nice stretchy fabric. I used to wear baggy, knee-length basketball shorts. I bought the Apex Perform in a 7"" inseam and love that they fall around mid-thigh. I got two pairs in different colors and plan to get more. I won't be going back to the sloppy, baggy look.",5,TRUE
"These shorts are comfy, true to size. 5 stars!!!!!",5,TRUE
These are great leggings… thick material and comfy to wear. Just disappointed that in less than a week of wear the seam has split. This is my second pair and the first did the same. If the seam stitching was improved these would be the perfect gym legging and well-worth the price.,3,FALSE
"Lovely color and fabric, but I don't like the scrunch as it's not placed right. Not ok for a rather high priced product...",3,FALSE
"Disappointed that this top doesn't match the leggings of the same name/colour ""Charcoal Marl"". Their colour, pattern and material are quite different, not a set. The top also doesn't fit well on one shoulder, possibly produced unevenly.  For the price I don't mind keeping it and hope might improve after a wash.  The leggings are far better quality than the top.",3,FALSE
They are definitely very comfy only down side is the waist was a little big and Ik if I sized down they wouldn’t fit my legs but other than that I love them.,4,TRUE
"Fällt eher enger aus, vielleicht lieber eine Nummer größer bestellen.",4,TRUE
"i am inlove with these shorts! very ideal for hiit, it doesn't curl up.",5,TRUE
Die Hose ist qualitativ gut verarbeitet und sitzt gut. Beim Training ist sie locker und fühlt sich gut an.,5,TRUE
"Sehr schöne Hose, toller Farbverlauf. Sitzt perfekt!",5,TRUE
I’m a shorter guy 5’3” and these fit amazing! Hate having longer shorts since the usually catch at the knees. Just need it in more colors.,5,TRUE
"Great fit and colour - I got a size M and I’m usually a 10 in all bottoms, these are perfect and so comfy",5,TRUE
I absolutely love these leggings i really wish they didn’t discontinue these because they fit so amazing,5,TRUE
"I thought id try gymshark as i needed new black leggins and these were on sale. I usually buy from another big brand and have always loved those, so thought i might aswell try another brand and have two places where i can order good leggins. The material is thick but stretchy enough to be comfortable, but they are too thick for my liking. I liked the large logo at the back, which is very neat. The legs part is nice and flattering but i have to say that even though the bum has a tiny scrunch bit, it still makes a unibum and due to the thickness of the fabric, you cant really yank them up, if you know what i mean. They are squat proof and dont roll down during cardio, which is a plus. They are ok leggins, but i prefer mine to be buttery soft and like a second skin. These are just a bit too thick for me. Also, the stiching on one of the thighs was loose and sticking out. All in all, they are ok black leggings, but i wouldnt buy another pair.",3,FALSE
great fit...................................................,5,TRUE
"Sehr komprimierend, dicker Stoff, figurbetont, schmeichelnd",4,TRUE
Got it wife for her training who was very pleased with it as it fits her body contours really well.,5,TRUE
"I’m fairly new to gymshark and I do like the quality of their items. Initially putting these on they were soooooo soft and I thought I would love them. Once I started working out, they’re very hot and I do find myself having to pull them back up throughout my workout. 

I just think this style isn’t for me.",3,FALSE
Schnitt ist seht gut aber der Stoff könnte etwas dicker sein.,4,TRUE
"They look and fit so good, only little bit see through. Anyway, I love to train in them",5,TRUE
Fits a little tighter than I expected. I wear Medium hoodies of every other brand but this was closer to a small.,2,FALSE
Excellent fit and design.  Material is breathable and very comfortable for workouts,4,TRUE
This Crewneck is a beautiful color and so soft and cozy on the inside,5,TRUE
"I love the color and booty contour on these leggings, but they are not supportive enough. I like my leggings with a little belly support and these leggings just feel a baggy on my waist. Maybe sizing is off, but I am a Medium in all other gymshark leggings.",3,FALSE
"Der Stoff ist toll und die Leggings sitzt perfekt, die Po Kontur ist bei mir persönlich ein bisschen zu weit unten, aber das ist natürlich bei jedem anderst . Aber allgemein eine super Leggings .",4,TRUE
"I love it so much, but I should’ve got in a size M. I’m 5’1 and 54kg btw",4,TRUE
"Love this product. Fits nice and it is good compression, cute scrunch and best it is squat proof. One of my favorite in gymshark collection",5,TRUE
they were to baggy in the crotch. I was hoping they would be low rise and not so much room in the front crotch,1,FALSE
